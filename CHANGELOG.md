# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Per each version, use either of these sub-chapters: `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`. Within these sub-chapters, add a line per JIRA ticket: `* <ticket ID>: <Ticket title>`. Turns out you need the Unreleased section! AND THE FORMAT FOR THE VERSION SECTION IS REALLY STRICT!
